# tsnuxt

> Testing Typescript integration

Very basic example of using the Vue Composition api in a Nuxt page.
You need to add @vue/composition-api through a plugin for this to work.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
